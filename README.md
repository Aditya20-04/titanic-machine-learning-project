# titanic-machine-learning-project
The Titanic project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to real-world classification problems. Through data analysis, feature engineering, and model tuning, we can build predictive models that extract meaningful insights and provide reliable predictions.

To build a predictive model that determines whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on features such as age, sex, class, fare, and others. The goal is to apply machine learning algorithms to gain insights into survival patterns and improve classification accuracy.
